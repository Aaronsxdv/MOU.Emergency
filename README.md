Full-stack web application with VueJS front and NodeJS backend.
The application is a hub for certified, state-approved volunteers with first aid certifications to help people in need before the ambulance is able to arrive. They are able to see the medical data of the injured person, which are acquired from the Slovensko v Mobile MOU app.
